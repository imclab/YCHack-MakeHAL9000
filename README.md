Make HAL9000
======

We are hacking together parts of the fictional character of HAL 9000 (i.e., a super intelligent computer in the movie- 2001: A Space Odyssey). HAL 9000 operates on networked machines. We put together sensors (e.g., biosensors and environment sensors), object and face recognition, and logics to find relationship among the data.
