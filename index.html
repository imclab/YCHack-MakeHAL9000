<p>We are hacking together parts of the fictional character of HAL 9000 (i.e., a super intelligent computer in the movie- 2001: A Space Odyssey). HAL 9000 operates on networked machines. We put together sensors (e.g., biosensors and environment sensors), object and face recognition, and logics to find relationship among the data. We'd like to keep working on this hack so that we can use it at home as a private data network. </p>

<p>We are proud of our hack-ish system that actually takes in multiple sensor streams and make inferences from it. For example, HAL 9000 found me drinking a coke and stored this information. This system also automatically finds relationships (i.e., correlation) among different sensor data.</p>

<p>We believe by deploying this system at home. It could gradually infer many relationships in the home environment. </p>
